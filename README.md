# Redshifts - Emission Lines
Repository consists of Python files I created during my 2018 and 2019 summer SEPnet internships. I rebinned the spectra to log-wavelength scale, and used cross-correlation functions to find emission lines in spectra of different types of galaxies. I then extracted spectroscopic redshift (in the redshift range 0 < z < 6) from the emission lines. Used FITS file for the original dataset, containing approx. 8000 spectra. Check poster for details. All the coding during the internship was completed by me.
