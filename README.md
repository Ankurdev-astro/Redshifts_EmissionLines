# Redshifts_EmissionLines
Repository consists of Python files I created during my 2018 and 2019 summer SEPnet internships. I used cross-correlation functions to find emission lines in spectra of different types galaxies. I then extracted spectroscopic redshift information from the emission lines. Used .fits file for the original dataset, containing Â¬8000 spectra.
